## Characteristics That Affect Coupon Acceptance or Rejection

This project explores the factors that influence whether drivers accept or reject coupons for expensive restaurants. By analyzing a dataset filtered specifically for this coupon category, key attributes are identified that help distinguish drivers who are more likely to accept the offer from those who are more likely to reject it.

The analysis reveals two sets of attributes:
- Positive Attributes – Increase the probability of coupon acceptance and decrease rejection.
- Negative Attributes – Decrease the probability of acceptance and increase rejection.

These insights can help coupon distributors:
- Strategically target drivers who are more likely to redeem offers for upscale dining
- Reconsider issuing coupons in scenarios matching negative attributes

### Positive Attributes

These attributes are associated with a higher likelihood of coupon **acceptance**:

- **Coupon Expiration**: 1 day, or
- **Coffee House Visits**: 1–3 times, or
- **Temperature**: 80°F, or
- **Expensive Restaurant Visits**: 1–3 times

*With these characteristics, drivers are approximately 10%–21% more likely to accept the coupon than reject it.*

### Negative Attributes

These attributes correlate with a greater chance of coupon **rejection**:

- **Coupon Expiration**: 2 hours, or
- **Time of Offer**: 10PM, or
- **Temperature**: 30°F, or
- **Expensive Restaurant Visits**: never, or
- **Family Status**: has children

*With these characteristics, drivers are approximately 16%–24% more likely to reject the coupon than accept it.*
